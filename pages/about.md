# **About Me**

Hi! My name is **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br>
I am a first year Ph.D. student at the University of Missouri (<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://missouri.edu/'>Mizzou</a>) advised by <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='http://calla.rnet.missouri.edu/cheng/'>Jianlin Cheng</a>. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, bioinformatics, and computer vision. In particular, I am interested in research that explores how structured prediction algorithms can be extended by the predictive power of deep neural networks for their innovative uses in computational biology, computer vision, natural language processing, and a host of other fields like computer graphics and simulations. I received my B.S. in computer science with a minor in mathematics from Missouri Western State University (<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://www.missouriwestern.edu/'>MWSU</a>).
