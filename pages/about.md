# **About Me**

Hi! My name is **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br>
I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Missouri (<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://missouri.edu/'>Mizzou</a>) advised by <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='http://calla.rnet.missouri.edu/cheng/'>Jianlin Cheng</a>. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, bioinformatics, and computer vision. I am particularly interested in research that explores how to augment structured prediction algorithms with the predictive power of deep neural networks for innovative applications in computational biology, computer vision, and natural language processing. Previously, I received my B.S. in computer science with a minor in mathematics from Missouri Western State University  (<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://www.missouriwestern.edu/'>MWSU</a>).
