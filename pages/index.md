I am a senior year CS undergraduate student at IIIT Jabalpur, India.
Currently, I’m interning as a Data Scientist at NeenOpal Inc., where I am working as a
part of the forecasting team to make predictions for one of the largest tile manufacturing organization in Sri Lanka.

When I’m not working at the screen, I’m either banging my head to heavy metal, chilling out
with hiphop/R&B songs, or write about my opinions over various music albums and bands on my music blog.
